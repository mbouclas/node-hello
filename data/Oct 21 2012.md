# What does this picture mean?

Recently, [Dominic Tarr][0] asked me why I used this image (seen at the left, 
but not on mobile) for my blog. The image is from William Cheseldenâ€™s 
[Osteographia or the Anatomy of the Bones][1]. Here is the complete 
illustration.

The one in the center is really expressive. His emotional posture animated and
then captured in time. I think he's holding an implement, a shovel? He looks 
like a laborer and he's definitely got something to say about the work he does.

This scene and its actors exist within the abstract, like software; an 
arrangement of concepts derived from material artifacts combined to achieve 
an expression.
